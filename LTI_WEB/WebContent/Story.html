<strong>&copy Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply <b>dummy</b> <i>text of the printing and typesetting industry</i>. 
<em>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</em>, <mark>when an unknown printer
took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book</mark>. It has survived not only five centuries, 
but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <small>It was popularised</small> in 
the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
